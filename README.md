# tf-null-provider
This repo serves as an explanation and learning exercice for the null provider in Terraform

## Description of the Terraform null_provider

The null provider ([official documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/null/latest/docs))is a rather-unusual provider that has constructs that intentionally do nothing. 

*Important note :*
 > Usage of the null provider can make a Terraform configuration harder to understand. While it can be useful in certain cases, it should be applied with care and other solutions preferred when available.

The null provider consists of :
* The **null_data_source** data source which implements the standard data source lifecycle but does not interact with any external APIs.
Historically, the null_data_source was typically used to construct intermediate values to re-use elsewhere in configuration. The same is now achieved using [locals](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/locals.html). _We'll not cover the __deprecated null_data_source__ in this repo._

* The **null_resource** resource. Instances of null_resource are treated like normal resources, but they don't do anything.
_The main advantage of this resource is the __ability to update or recreate other resources in response of a null_resource change.__

Taking the below main.tf file example :

```
provider "aws" {
    region     = "eu-central-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "server1" {
    ami           = "ami-05fa05752fc432eeb" # bionic64
    #ami           = "ami-091d856a5f5701931" # nginx64
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    tags = {
        "Name" = "server1"
    }
}

resource "aws_instance" "server2" {
    ami           = "ami-05fa05752fc432eeb"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    tags = {
        "Name" = "server2"
    }
}

resource "null_resource" "null" {
    triggers = {
    # Changes to any ami instance requires re-provisioning of this null_resource
        instance_ami_ids = "${join(",", [aws_instance.server1.ami, aws_instance.server2.ami])}"
    }
    
    # As a result of re-creating the null_resource the provisioners are re-run
    provisioner "local-exec" {
      command = "echo ami in one of two instances had changed. Server1 public_dns is: ${aws_instance.server1.public_dns}"
    }
}

```

This terraform file creates :
* 2 ubuntu aws instances
* A null_resource resource which :
  * Gather data of both instances and create a concatenated string of the ami ids via the join function within the triggers map to compare upon on next run. Triggers are a map of values, when changed, that will cause (the null resource to be replaced and) the set of associate provisioners to re-run
  * Run a simple echo command via the local-exec provisioner 

In this example after any change of ami id, due to the triggers map, the null_resource will be re-created and the provisioner will be re-run.
Here the provisioner only runs an echo command and write the first instance public_dns to stdout but more powerfull actions can be configured.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.server1 will be created
  + resource "aws_instance" "server1" {
  
  # ...
  
  Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

```


* Edit the main.tf file and change tags Name for server1 instance

```
 -         "Name" = "server1"
 +         "Name" = "web1"
```


* Run terraform apply again and note that the null resource is not re-created and the provisioner not re-run

Sample output :

```
terraform apply

* Note how this time the null resource is re-created and as a result the provisioner is also re-run

### Cleanup

* Run terraform destroy to delete the created ec2 instances

```
terraform destroy
```
